# livewriting

Live Writing, a web-based writing platform where keystrokes are recorded with timestamps and the writing can be reproduced as if it is typed in real-time. The core idea of live writing is to reveal the intermediate dynamical process of writing and to incorporate temporal change as part of expression in writing.
